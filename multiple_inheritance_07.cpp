/*Single inheritance is implemented as
Class DerivedClass_name : access_specifier Base_Class{};
Single inheritance constructs an inheritance tree
Single inheritance is a lot close to specialization..

Multiple inheritance is implemented as
Class DerivedClass_name : access_specifier Base_Class1, access_specifier Base_Class2, â€¦.{};.
Multiple inheritance constructs Inheritance Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
multiple inheritance is a lot close to generalization...*/
